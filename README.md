Curation by Me
==============
Curation by Me is an experiment in Twitter Lists and filters.

Summary
-------
This site is just about scratching an itch. I wanted to be able to filter tweets from a list based on a hashtag or keyword so I built something simple to do that.

Notes
-----
1. The site defaults to a list and hashtag related to the Irish General Election in 2011
2. But you can use any list URL and any hashtag or keyword
3. Open multiple browsers tabs to track multiple things
4. Click on the link on the person's name to see that tweet on Twitter so you can reply/retweet/etc
5. It doesn't auto-refresh because that would use up your API accesses to Twitter
6. The pagination is screwy for a good reason


Coming Soon
-----------
1. Fewer bugs
2. AND/OR in the filter
3. Some styling (maybe)
4. Bug Reports, Feature Requests, Awards
5. Sentiment analysis
